#rustD
Stands for Robotic Unmanned System for Tool Distribution. 
Or Robotic Unmanned System for Trash Disposal....my kids want it to take the trash to the road

To compile the code with the jar file in the same directory as the rustD1.java file use the following steps:

javac -cp ".;jSerialComm-1.3.11.jar" rustD1.java

To run the code...again the .jar file is in the same directory as the compiled file use the following
java -cp ".;jSerialComm-1.3.11.jar" rustD1
